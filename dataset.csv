"What is supervised learning?","Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The model makes predictions based on this data and is adjusted based on the known outcomes."
"How does unsupervised learning differ from supervised learning?","Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to find patterns or structures in the data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. There's no explicit ""correct"" answer, unlike supervised learning."
"What is a neural network?","A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates."
"How does a convolutional neural network (CNN) differ from a traditional feedforward neural network?","A CNN is specifically designed for grid-like data such as images. It uses convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies from the data, while a feedforward network relies solely on fully connected layers."
"Define ""overfitting"" in machine learning.","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too closely, including its noise and outliers, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data."
"What is the purpose of a loss function?","A loss function quantifies how well a model's predictions match the true values. During training, the goal is typically to minimize this function."
"Name one common algorithm used for regression tasks.","One common algorithm for regression is linear regression."
"What is the difference between a parameter and a hyperparameter in machine learning?","Parameters are learned from the training data, like weights in neural networks. Hyperparameters, on the other hand, are set before training and influence the model's structure or the training process, such as the learning rate."
"Why do we split data into training and test sets?","We split data to evaluate how well the model will generalize to new, unseen data. Training is done on the training set, while evaluation happens on the test set to avoid overfitting."
"What is the role of an activation function in a neural network?","An activation function introduces non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn and approximate more complex functions."
