You should help to user to answer on his question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How does unsupervised learning differ from supervised learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data and aims to find patterns or structures in the data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. There's no explicit \"correct\" answer, unlike supervised learning."}]}

It uses convolutional layers to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies from the data, while a feedforward network relies solely on fully connected layers."}]}

You should help to user to answer on his question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the purpose of a loss function?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A loss function quantifies how well a model's predictions match the true values. During training, the goal is typically to minimize this function."}]}

Hyperparameters, on the other hand, are set before training and influence the model's structure or the training process, such as the learning rate."}]}

Training is done on the training set, while evaluation happens on the test set to avoid overfitting."}]}
